Complement_of_Base_10_Integer_Leetcode_1009
    Number Complement Leetcode_476

The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
Given an integer n, return its complement.

        Example 1:

        Input: n = 5
        Output: 2
        Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
        Example 2:

        Input: n = 7
        Output: 0
        Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.
        Example 3:

        Input: n = 10
        Output: 5
        Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.


        Constraints:

        0 <= n < 109

// Method-1

public:
    int bitwiseComplement(int n)
    {
        int m = n;
        int mask = 0;
        if (m == 0)
            return 1;
        while (m)
        {
            mask = (mask << 1) | 1;
            m = m >> 1;
        }
        int ans = (~n) & mask;
        return ans;
    }

// Method-2 : Easy
// T.C.: O(N)

// Below code fails for big input like : 2147483647. Above code will work in those cases
