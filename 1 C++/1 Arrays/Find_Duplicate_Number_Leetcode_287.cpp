/*
Find_Duplicate_Number_Leetcode_287

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

Constraint : All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.

//Here bit approach didn't work bcz they played in constraint, the repeated number can be repeated many times. While the bit approach work only for  1 repetition
