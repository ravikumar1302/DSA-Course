Draw_the_Diamond_Codestudio
You have to print a regular grid pattern of 'R' rows and 'C' columns with a diamond-like shape of size 'S' in each cell of the grid. 
The diamond shape will contain ‘/’ and ‘\’ characters to represent the borders of the diamond and ‘o’ (small ‘o’ alphabet) to represent the space inside the diamond and ‘e’(small ‘e’ alphabet) to represent the rest of the space of diamond.

For example:
e/\e
/oo\
\oo/
e\/e

The above diagram represents a grid of 1 Row and 1 Column and a diamond of size 2 in its single cell(i.e. each side of the diamond has length 2).
