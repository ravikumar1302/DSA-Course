/*
N_Stacks_In_An_Array_Codestudio

Design a data structure to implement ‘N’ stacks using a single array of size ‘S’. It should support the following operations:
push(X, M): Pushes an element X into the Mth stack. Returns true if the element is pushed into the stack, otherwise false.

pop(M): Pops the top element from Mth Stack. Returns -1 if the stack is empty, otherwise, returns the popped element.

    Two types of queries denote these operations :
    Type 1: for push(X, M) operation.
    Type 2: for pop(M) operation.
