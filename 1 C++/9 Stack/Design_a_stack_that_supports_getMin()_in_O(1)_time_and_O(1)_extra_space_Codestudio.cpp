Design_a_stack_that_supports_getMin()_in_O(1)_time_and_O(1)_extra_space_Codestudio

Implement a SpecialStack Data Structure that supports getMin() in O(1) time and O(1) extra space along with push(), pop(), top(), isEmpty(), isFull() in O(1). To implement SpecialStack, you should only use inbuilt Stack data structure.
    Implement The Following Public Functions :
    1. push(data) :
    This function should take one argument of type integer. It pushes the element into the stack and returns nothing.

    2. pop() :
    It pops the element from the top of the stack and, in turn, returns the element being popped or deleted. In case the stack is empty, it returns -1.

    3. top() :
    It returns the element being kept at the top of the stack. In case the stack is empty, it returns -1.

    4. isEmpty() :
    It returns a boolean value indicating whether the stack is empty or not.

    5. getMin() :
    It returns the smallest element present in the stack. In case the stack is empty, it returns -1.
