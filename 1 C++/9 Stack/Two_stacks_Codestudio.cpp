/*
Two_stacks_Codestudio

Design a data structure, which represents two stacks using only one array common for both stacks. The data structure should support the following operations:
push1(NUM) - Push ‘NUM’ into stack1.
push2(NUM) - Push ‘NUM’ into stack2.
pop1() - Pop out a top element from stack1 and return popped element, in case of underflow return -1.
pop2() - Pop out a top element from stack2 and return popped element, in case of underflow return -1.
There are 2 types of queries in the input
Type 1 - These queries correspond to Push operation.
Type 2 - These queries correspond to Pop operation.
Note:
1. You are given the size of the array.

2. You need to perform push and pop operations in such a way that we are able to push elements in the stack until there is some empty space available in the array.

3. While performing Push operations, do nothing in the situation of the overflow of the stack.
