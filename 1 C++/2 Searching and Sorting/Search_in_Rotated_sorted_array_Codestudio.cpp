IMPORTANT QUESTION (ASKED IN MANY COMPANIES)

You have been given a sorted array/list ARR consisting of ‘N’ elements. You are also given an integer ‘K’.
Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. For example, if ARR = [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 8]. Then after rotating ARR at index 3, the array will be ARR = [7, 8, 1, 3, 5].
Now, your task is to find the index at which ‘K’ is present in ARR.
    Note :
    1. If ‘K’ is not present in ARR then print -1.
    2. There are no duplicate elements present in ARR. 
    3. ARR can be rotated only in the right direction.
