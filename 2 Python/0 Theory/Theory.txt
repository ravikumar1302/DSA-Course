    - Case-Sensitivity in Python : Sensative (All are in Lowercase except - True, False and None)

1. File extension : .py
2. Some points to remember : 
    - Python is case sensetive. So, print and Print are different
    - No need of semicolon in Python
    - As curly braces {}, are not used in python, the indentation is necessary, means proper spaces in outer and inner loop
    - 


3. Features : 
    - There is no need to define the type of variable in Python, just enter the vale, type will be assigned to it
    - So, no need to define short int, long int etc. Directly write a=243543535... etc, unlike C/C++/Java
