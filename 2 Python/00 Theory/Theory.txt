0. Libraries in Python :
    - NumPy : For numerical (mathematical & statistical) Computation
    - Pandas : Analyzing tabular data
    - Matplotlib & Seaborn : Create Data Visualization with these 2 libraries (graphs, maps etc)
    
    - Pyhton Comments : 
                Single line = # text 
                Multiple line = """ text """
    - Case-Sensitivity in Python : Sensative (All are in Lowercase except - True, False and None)

1. File extension : .py
2. Some points to remember : 
    - Python is case sensetive. So, print and Print are different
    - No need of semicolon in Python
    - As curly braces {}, are not used in python, the indentation is necessary, means proper spaces in outer and inner loop
    - 


3. Features : 
    - There is no need to define the type of variable in Python, just enter the vale, type will be assigned to it
    - So, no need to define short int, long int etc. Directly write a=243543535... etc, unlike C/C++/Java
    - Boleans are treated as integer in expression. e.g. c=print(True +True) = 2
    - Divsion operator (/) always return float value even 4/2 type will also be float

4. Data Types in Python : By default Python have these data types:
        strings - used to represent text data, the text is given under quote marks. e.g. "ABCD"
        integer - used to represent integer numbers. e.g. -1, -2, -3
        float - used to represent real numbers. e.g. 1.2, 42.42
        boolean - used to represent True or False.
        complex - used to represent complex numbers. e.g. 1.0 + 2.0j, 1.5 + 2.5j
        
5. string
    - Should be enclosed in single(' ') or double(" ") quotes
    - You can use single quote inside double quote, but opposite will create an issue
    - Else you can use escape character(\) like " his son\'s name is " to print his son's name is
    - For multi line string, use triple quotes ("""  """)
