Matplotlib & Seaborn : Create Data Visualization with these 2 libraries (graphs, maps etc)

1. Generally, Seaborn is used to butify the results produced by matplotlib
    - Both are used together also sometime.
    - Like, attributes of both are used

2. import seaborn as sns
    sns.set_style("whitegrid")

3. sns.load_dataset(" ")    # seaborn as some sample csv file to work with like iris etc

4. sns.scatterplot(x_axis, y_axis) : to plot scatter plot using seaborn
    - seaborn scatterplot is more powerful than matplotlib scatterplot in terms of functions and power

5. Seaborn automatically pics the column name as chart x and y axis label, hence saving some line of code as compared to matplotlib
6.
