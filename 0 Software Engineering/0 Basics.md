1. Principles of Software Engineering
   | Principle | Full Form | Clear Explanation |
   | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **SOLID** | Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion | A set of 5 rules that help write clean, flexible code where changes don’t break existing features. |
   | **Single Responsibility (S)** | — | One class or module should do only one job. |
   | **Open/Closed (O)** | — | Code should allow new features without changing existing code. |
   | **Liskov Substitution (L)** | — | A child class should work wherever its parent class is expected. |
   | **Interface Segregation (I)** | — | Don’t force a class to implement methods it doesn’t need. |
   | **Dependency Inversion (D)** | — | High-level code should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations. |
   | **GRASP** | General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns | Principles that guide how to assign responsibilities to classes and objects. |
   | **GRASP (Core idea)** | — | Give responsibilities to the class best suited to handle them. |
   | **DRY** | Don’t Repeat Yourself | Avoid duplicating logic; put it in one place and reuse it. |
   | **KISS** | Keep It Simple, Stupid | Prefer simple solutions over complex ones for better readability and maintenance. |
