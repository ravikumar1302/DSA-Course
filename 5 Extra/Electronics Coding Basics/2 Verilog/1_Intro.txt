- Extension for file is :  .v, .verilog, .vlg
-  Verilog is a HDL (Hardware Description Language) used to model electronic systems. It is used for VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration)
- It is most commonly used in the design and verification of digital circuits at the register-transfer level of abstraction

First appeared: 1984
Paradigm: Structured

- It is language using which designer can specify the behavior/ functionality of some giver hardware.
- 2 style of design : behavioral and structual design style
- It is used to write testbenches and analyze simulation results : to verify design is working correctly or not
- It is used to model combinational and sequential circuits

1. VLSI Design Process
    - Design complexity increasing rapidly (over the years)
        - Increased size and complexity
        - Fabrication technology improving (from manual to Computrized now)
        - CAD tools are essential
        - Conflicting requirements like area, speed, and energy consumption

    - The present trend
        - Standardize the design flow
        - Emphasis on low-power design, and increased performance

2. Moore's Law : Every 18 months, the no of transistor will double in the same size IC
    - Exponential growth
    - Design complexity increases rapidly
    - Automated tools are essential
    - Must follow well- defined design flow

3. VLSI Design Flow
    - Standardized design procedure
        - Starting from the design idea down to the actual implementation.

    - Encompasses many steps:
        - Specification
        - Synthesis
        - Simulation
        - Layout
        - Testability analysis
        - and many more......
    - Need to use Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools
        - These are based on HDL (Hardware Description Language)
        - HDLs provide formats for representing the output of various design steps
        - A CAD tool transforms its HDL input into a HDL output that contains more detailed information about the hardware.
            • Behavioral level to register transfer level
            • Register transfer level to gate level
            • Gate level to transistor level
            • Transistor level to the layout level
        - 

4. Two Copmering HDLs
    a) Verilog
    b) VHDL ( VHSIC Hardware Description Language." VHSIC stands for "Very High Speed Integrated Circuit.")  VHDL is a programming language used to describe the structure and behavior of digital logic circuits.
    - Designs are created typically HDLs, which get transformed from one level of abstraction to the next as the design flow progresses.
    - There are other HDLs like SystemC, SystemVerilog and many more....

5. Simplistic View od Design Flow : 
    a) Design idea ->
    b) Behavioral Design (Flow Graph, Pusedo Code) ->
    c) Data Path Design (Bus/Register Structure) ->
    d) Logic Design (Gate/ F-F Netlist) ->
    e) Physical Design (Transistor Layout)  ->
    f) Manufacturing
    g) Chip/ Board

6. Steps in the Design Flow
    a) Behavioral design
        - Specify the functionality of the design in terms of its behavior. 
        - Various ways of specifying:
            • Boolean expression or truth table.
            • Finite-state machine behavior (e.g. state transition diagram or table). 
            • In the form of a high-level algorithm.
        - Needs to be synthesized into more detailed specifications for hardware realization.
    
    b) Data path design
        - Generate a netlist of register transfer level components, like registers, adders, multipliers, multiplexers, decoders, etc.
        - A netlist is a directed graph, where the vertices indicate components, and the edges indicate interconnections.
        - A netlist specification is also referred to as structural design.
            • Netlist may be specified at various levels, where the components may be functional modules, gates or transistors.
            • Systematically transformed from one level to the next.
    
    c) Logic design
        - Generate a netlist of gates/flip-flops or standard cells.
        — A standard cell is a pre-designed circuit module (like gates, flip-flops, multiplexer, etc.) at the layout level.
        — Various logic optimization techniques are used to obtain a cost effective design.
        - There may be conflicting requirements during optimization: 
            • Minimize number of gates.
            • Minimize number of gate levels (i.e. delay).
            • Minimize signal transition activities (i.e. dynamic power).
    
    d) Physical design and Manufacturing
        - Generate the final layout that can be sent for fabrication.
        - The layout contains a large number of regular geometric shapes corresponding to the different fabrication layers.
        - Alternatively, the final target may be Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), where technology mapping from the gate level netlist is used. 
            - Can be programmed in-field.
            - Much greater flexibility, but less speed.

    e) Other Steps in the Design Flow
        - Simulation for verification
            - At various levels: logic level, switch level, circuit level
        - Formal verification
            - Used to verify the designs through formal techniques (using some mathematical techniques)
        - Testability analysis and Test pattern generation 
            - Required for testing the manufactured devices
