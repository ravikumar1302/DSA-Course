1. Design Representation
    - A design can be represented at various levels from three different points of view:
        1. Behavioral Domain : Programs, Specification, Truth Table 
        2. Structural Domain : Gates, adders, Registers
        3. Physical Domain : Transistors/ Layout, Cells, Chips/Boards
    - Can be conveniently expressed by Y-diagram. (with above 3 domain at each end of vertex of Y)

2. Behavioral	Representa+on	
    • Specifies how	a particular design	should respond to a	given set of inputs.		
    • May be specified by:	
        – Boolean equations	
        – Tables of	input and output values	
        – Algorithms written in standard HLL like C	
        – Algorithms written in special HDL like Verilog or VHDL
    
    Example : Full Adder:	
        – two operand inputs A and B	
        – a	carry input	C	
        – a	carry output Cy	
        – a	sum	output S	
        • Express	in	terms	of	Boolean	expressions:	
                S = A.Bʹ.Cʹ	+	Aʹ.Bʹ.C	+	Aʹ.B.Cʹ	+	A.B.C =	A⊕B⊕C	
                Cy	= A.B	+	A.C	+	B.C	
        
    • Express in Verilog in	terms of Boolean expressions
		module carry (S, Cy, A, B, C);      // Similar to c++ function
            input A, B, C; 
            output S, Cy; 
            assign S = A ^ B ^ C; 
            assign Cy = (A & B) | (B & C) | (C & A); 
        endmodule
